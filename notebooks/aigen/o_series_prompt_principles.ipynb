    "\n",
    "| Prompting Principle | What it means for **o-series reasoning models (o4-mini & o1)** |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **1 — Use a `developer` message (not system) and give a clear role** | The newest reasoning models treat a *system* message as a *developer* message; mixing both is discouraged. Put the high‑level instruction in a single `role:\"developer\"` message, e.g., “You are an expert tax lawyer…”. |\n",
    "| **2 — Keep prompts simple & direct — don’t force chain‑of‑thought** | Reasoning models already “think” internally. Over‑specifying (“think step‑by‑step… explain every thought”) wastes tokens and can leak private reasoning. Ask only for the final answer unless you truly need a public explanation. |\n",
    "| **3 — Use explicit delimiters to structure input** | Wrap long passages, code, or multi‑part instructions in clear fences (` ````, `<doc>…</doc>`, Markdown headings). Delimiters help the model parse sections correctly and reduce mis‑interpretation. |\n",
    "| **4 — Supply *only* the relevant context** | With 200 k‑token windows you can paste huge docs—but you *shouldn’t*. Include the minimal excerpts the task needs so the model focuses on the right evidence and stays concise. |\n",
    "| **5 — Decompose or iterate instead of one giant ask (try zero‑shot first)** | Start with a straightforward version, examine the answer, then refine or break the workflow into numbered sub‑tasks. This lets the model reason deeply on each step and saves tokens. |\n",
    "| **6 — Specify output format & boundaries** | Tell the model exactly *how* to answer (JSON schema, Markdown table, “≤ 120 words”, etc.). Reasoning models follow detailed format guards well and will keep their lengthy analysis inside your boundaries. |\n"

      "Hi, friends! Today we’re going to learn about “reasoning models.” That sounds like a big phrase, but it’s really just talking about ways our brain figures things out. Think of it like different tools or helpers we can use when we want to solve a problem or answer a question. Let’s look at three simple helpers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. “Step‑by‑Step” Helper  \n",
      "   • Imagine you’re making a peanut‑butter sandwich. You follow steps:  \n",
      "     1) Take two slices of bread.  \n",
      "     2) Spread peanut butter on one slice.  \n",
      "     3) Put the slices together.  \n",
      "   • When we solve a question, we can do the same—go one small step at a time until we get our answer!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. “Pattern Detective” Helper  \n",
      "   • A detective looks for clues and patterns. For example, you see: 2, 4, 6, 8, __.  \n",
      "   • You notice “each number goes up by 2.” So the next number is 10!  \n",
      "   • Our brain can be a pattern detective, too, spotting what’s the same or what comes next.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. “Treasure‑Map” Helper (Working Backward)  \n",
      "   • Pretend you want to find buried treasure. You know the X on the map, and you work backward from X to the starting tree.  \n",
      "   • In thinking, sometimes you start with the answer you want, then figure out each clue in reverse until you begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why use these helpers?  \n",
      "- They keep our thoughts neat and easy to follow.  \n",
      "- They help us check each little piece, so we don’t get lost.  \n",
      "- They make tricky problems feel simple, like a fun game!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s try one together:  \n",
      "Question: “I have 3 red apples and 2 green apples. How many apples do I have in all?”  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Step‑by‑Step Helper:  \n",
      "  1) Count the red apples: 3.  \n",
      "  2) Count the green apples: 2.  \n",
      "  3) Add them: 3 + 2 = 5.  \n",
      "Answer: 5 apples!\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t that fun? Anytime you have a question—math, reading, or how to clean up your toys—you can pick one of these helpers (or even all three!) and watch your brain light up with the answers. Great job learning about reasoning models today!\n",
